# language-switcher-for-eid

This is a mod for The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth which allows you to toggle between two languages for the [External Item Descriptions](https://github.com/wofsauge/External-Item-Descriptions) mod by [wofsauge](https://github.com/wofsauge). I made it because I wanted to play local coop with a korean friend. It is my first mod and I don't really know Lua, so feel free to suggest changes.

I don't think Repentance+ is required, but I don't really know.

## Features

Switching between predefined language: `{"en_us", "fr", "pt", "pt_br", "ru", "spa", "it", "bul", "pl", "de", "tr_tr", "ko_kr", "zh_cn", "ja_jp", "cs_cz", "nl_nl", "uk_ua", "el_gr"}`, which are found [here](https://github.com/wofsauge/External-Item-Descriptions/blob/master/main.lua). In the code the default languages to switch between are `en_us` and `ko_kr`, but you can change them to any of the languages EID supports.

The default keybinds are `X` and `Numpad /`. Both toggle the language in the same way. Add and remove the keybinds as you wish.

## Installation

Copy the `lang_switcher_for_eid` folder into your Isaac Mods folder at `...\steamapps\common\The Binding of Isaac Rebirth\mods`
